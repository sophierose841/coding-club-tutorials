# Working Efficiently with Large Datasets Notes

# .RData file used instead of .csv - easier for large datasets.

# 1. Formatting and Tidying - Tidyr
# gather() used.
# Cannot run analysis on untidy datasets.
# Ideally, each row represents an observation and each column represents a variable.

# Tidied data set so year is in one column and population in another.
